GameBlendJS is a WebGL/Babylon.js based game engine.  It 
uses the .blend file format from Blender as it's main file format.  

Since .blend files are structured memory dumps, GameBlendJS 
implements Blender's data structures as JS classes.

BlendJS uses its own class system and supports aspect-oriented
programming, which is more suited for game development (it's
much more powerful than normal mixins).
